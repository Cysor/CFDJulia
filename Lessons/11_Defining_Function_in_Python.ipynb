Barba, called **12 Steps to Navier–Stokes.** The interactive module starts with simple exercises in 1D that at first use little of the power of Python. We now present some new ways of doing the same things that are more efficient and produce prettier code.\n",

We were able to reuse code (to great effect!) by copying and pasting, to incrementally build a solver for the Burgers' equation. But moving forward there are more efficient ways to write our Python codes.  In this lesson, we are going to introduce *function definitions*, which will allow us more flexibility in reusing and also in organizing our code.  \n",
